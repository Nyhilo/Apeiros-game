def check_square(image: bytes) -> (int, int, int, int):
    '''
    Checks how square the image is. Returns a tuple indicating how many pixels
     the image is off from being square, the percentage of the difference from
     the short-side of the image, and the given width and height of the image.
     For instance, an image of size 200x210 would report return
     (pixels, percent, width, height) = (10, 5, 200, 210).

    Args:
        image (bytes): An image byte-input. Should be a png formatted image.
                        Use convert_png if not

    Returns:
        (int, int): (pixels_off, percent_off). Values indicating how far the
                     image is from being square.
