def check_square(image: bytes) -> (int, int):
    '''
    Checks how square the image is. Returns a tuple indicating how many pixels
     the image is off from being square and the percentage of the difference
     from the short-side of the image. For instance, an image of size 200x210
     would report return (pixels, percent) = (10, 5).

    Args:
        image (bytes): An image byte-input. Should be a png formatted image.
                        Use convert_png if not

    Returns:
        (int, int): (pixels_off, percent_off). Values indicating how far the
                     image is from being square.
